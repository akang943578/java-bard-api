It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. The White House was designed by James Hoban, an Irish-American architect. Construction began in 1792 and was completed in 1800.\n\nHere are some interesting facts about the White House:\n\n* The White House is the third-oldest public building in the United States.\n* The White House has 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels.\n* The White House has a bowling alley, a movie theater, and a swimming pool.\n* The White House is not actually white. It is made of a limestone called Aquia Sandstone, which is a light brown color. The White House was painted white in 1798 to hide the stains from the smoke of the cook fires.\n\nI hope you enjoy the picture!"
